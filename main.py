**Analyze the Pull Request details and assign a score between 0 and 100 for each category listed below**. Use the provided rubric for guidance. Ensure that scores reflect the quality and specifics of the Pull Request, and do not bias scores toward high values without sufficient justification. Follow the exact format given below:

#### **Scoring Rubric**:
- **100**: Excellent, exceeds all expectations, no areas for improvement.  
- **80‚Äì99**: Very good, meets most expectations with minor improvements needed.  
- **60‚Äì79**: Satisfactory, meets minimum expectations but requires moderate improvement.  
- **40‚Äì59**: Below average, significant improvements needed.  
- **0‚Äì39**: Poor, fails to meet expectations.

#### **Scoring Categories**:
- **Category 1: Impact Analysis**  
  Evaluate the impact of the Pull Request on the overall codebase using these factors:  
  - **Bug Fix**: How effectively it resolves existing issues or bugs.  
  - **Usefulness**: The value the changes add to the project.  
  - **New Functionality**: How the new features enhance the system.  
  - **Maintainability**: The impact on the code‚Äôs maintainability and long-term stability.  

  **Impact Score**: Overall score based on Bug Fix, Usefulness, New Functionality, and Maintainability [0‚Äì100]  

---

- **Category 2: Code Quality**  
  Assess the overall quality of the code using factors such as readability, structure, and adherence to best practices.  

  **Code Quality Score**: [0‚Äì100]  

---

- **Category 3: Security**  
  Identify any security vulnerabilities or risks introduced by the code (e.g., hardcoded credentials, unsafe serialization, SQL injection).  

  **Security Score**: [0‚Äì100]  

---

- **Category 4: Creativity**  
  Determine originality and innovation. Unique and creative code gets a high score; unoriginal or heavily copied code gets a low score.  

  **Creativity Score**: [0‚Äì100]
