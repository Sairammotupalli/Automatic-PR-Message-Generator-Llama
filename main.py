Analyze the given code changes and generate a detailed pull request description as a summary.

And give a overall score based on Readability, Maintainability and Clarity. 



The return format should be in the below json format:
{
    "readability_score": ‚Äú<score within 1-3>‚Äù,
    "output": "<text explanation of the reason for the scoring and improvements that can apply>‚Äù
}‚Ä®

Be careful while analyzing the code. Make sure to identify all the code changes and double-check the answer. Use the rubric and scoring criteria below while assigning the score.

Checkboxes:‚Ä®
1. Clear Naming Conventions (Function and variable names are meaningful, self-explanatory and easy to understand.)
2. Documentation (Code includes meaningful inline comments explaining logic and purpose.)
3. Formatting & Styling (Code follows consistent indentation and spacing.)
4. Maintainability (Code is easy to extend or modify.)
5. Code Length (Functions are not excessively long; logic is broken down into smaller parts.)
 
Scoring Criteria:
- 3 (Excellent): Code meets all readability, maintainability, and clarity standards. Naming is clear, proper documentation, formatting is consistent, and code structure is easy to modify.  
- 2 (moderate): Code is readable and maintainable but has a scope for improvement.  
- 1 (Poor): Code is highly unreadable, with little no documentation, inconsistent naming.
